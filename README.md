# Image Classifier Project

## Introduction
This project involves an image classification system designed to categorize images into predefined classes. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, leveraging the power of deep learning for accurate image recognition. The dataset used for training and evaluating the classifier is available online, complemented by indexing and metadata for efficient processing and retrieval of image data.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The core of this project is a CNN model, which is a type of deep neural network especially effective for image processing and classification tasks. CNNs are capable of automatically and adaptively learning spatial hierarchies of features from images. This project employs state-of-the-art CNN architectures, such as ResNet, Inception, or custom models tailored to the specific requirements of the dataset.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: These libraries provide the framework for defining, training, and deploying the CNN models.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing tasks and to prepare images for classification.
- **NumPy**: Essential for handling numerical operations, especially those related to manipulating image data.


## Setup and Running
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install '
4. For classification, use: `python classify.py <image_path>` (replace `<image_path>` with the path to your image).

## Note on Previews
The preview images included are meant to provide a quick look at the dataset and the classifier's capabilities. For a comprehensive understanding, delve into the dataset contained within the CIFAR data available online.
